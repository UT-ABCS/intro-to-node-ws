This project was taught as a Technical Project Workshop for the Association of Computer Scientists at the University of Texas at Austin. This project is complete, though small changes may be added in the future. You can find more information [here](https://github.com/UT-ABCS/tech-workshops).  <br />

This workshop will cover the basics of Node.js. The goal of this project is to create a local web server and a client that can send requests to that server. Each person has to update a file, git add, git commit, and git push the changes to the workshop branch. You can find the slides associated with this workshop at [this link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1J1E5u3azbRcKDQACORDbWs27YublF7Le7DyGDf35skk/edit?usp=sharing).  <br />
